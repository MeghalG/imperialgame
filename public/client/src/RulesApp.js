                        <p>The most important change is that countries are rules <b>democratically</b> rather than dictatorially. 
                            After a country makes their move (but before any investor purchase takes place), if the owner has &lt; 50% of the outstanding stock, then the person with the second-most stock makes an alternative proposal for a turn. 
                            Players vote with the stock that they hold, deciding between the two proposals. Voting is open at once to everyone with shares. If the alternative gets &gt; 50%, it happens immediately. If the original gets 50%, it happens immediately. You cannot send in your vote if the result has already been decided, but you can send in your vote even if it provably cannot affect the outcome. Votes are revealed once a result has been decided.
                            Proposals to end the game automatically pass, without any vote taking place.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Greatness bonuses are distributed according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%27Hondt_method" target="_blank">Jefferson method</a> based on total stock of each player in the country.
                            If there is a shortfall in an Investor action, extra spinning along the wheel, or a shortfall in paying for the Factory or Import actions, the proposer of the action takes full responsibility for paying the shortfall.
                            At any number of intermediate points during your maneuver, you may pause to resolve peace offers to other countries. You must resolve fleet peace offers before you may move any armies.
                            If you propose a maneuver with peace in a location, all players with votes in the other country should vote at once on accepting the peace offer. If both the leader and the opposition agree, or a majority agrees, or the leader and 50% total agree, then the voting immediately concludes.

                            Normally, whenever a country lands on or skips over investor, after the action has been resolved, an investor phase occurs. The person with the investor card receives $2, can purchase or upgrade a bond, and then passes the investor card to the next player (even if they didnâ€™t purchase).
                            Anyone who did not hold leadership of any country at the start of the turn may then also purchase or upgrade a bond. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In this variant, to get Swiss status, the player must also not hold opposition in any country.
                            Players may also <b>punt buys</b>. Any player who punts a buy receives Swiss status for future investor actions. Making any buy or upgrade causes them to lose this temporary Swiss Bank status, unless they still qualify by virtue of not holding government positions.
                            All swiss bank buys are resolved in counterclockwise order from the person who took the first investor action. Players without countries do not receive an automatic veto on skipping investor. No one may buy or upgrade in a country which has already been bought/upgraded as part of the same investor action.

                            Instead of the listed starting amounts, distribute $61 evenly between the players. Fractional money can be spent in the opening auction (but can only be bid in intervals of cents) and is otherwise only useful as a tiebreaker.
                            For each country, in turn order beginning with Austria, each player simultaneously chooses a real amount of money to bid. Arrange the bids in descending order, breaking all ties randomly. In descending order, each player may choose to pay their entire bid to buy one bond for which they have bid at least the normal cost.
                            After the opening auction for the last nation has concluded, the player with the most cash remaining receives the investor card. The seating order continues in descending order of remaining cash. All ties are broken randomly.
